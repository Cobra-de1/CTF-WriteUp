Welcome to SecureSoftware v1.5!!


The terms and Conditions are the same as v1, except for that which mentioned in this file.


Changes
-------

Previous one initializes by using -i, and you are to generate the key. In this, you should provide a KEY as stdin when initializing using -i.

Removal of the files are now done using -u. Use this arg to undo all the changes to the system.

Your Initial goal is to find your valid KEY, but a KEYGEN would be a welcoming Bonus. 

Patching IS ALLOWED, But only for non-core components. This contains anti-debugging techniques. You might want to patch that out if you want to use a debugger. 

Patching of CORE components are DISCOURAGED, although feel free to include a bug or shortcut that I left out unchecked in the writeup! Bonus points for that!!

Usage of Disassembler is ofc, allowed, and Debugger is also allowed provided you evaded the anti-debugging mechanism. However, It is DISCOURAGED to use a DECOMPILER, although you are allowed to use everything in your toolbox if you are stuck. 

IF YOU USE A DECOMPILER, PLEASE AVOID USING A DEBUGGER AND GO FULL STATIC ANALYSIS.

If you couldn't unlock it at all, as a last resort, you can ignore all the restritions. But negative points for that.



Bonus

This crackme has everything I know in terms of anti patching & debugging. So, Here is a challenge to completely disable all anti-debugging/patching techniques that I have done. For this challenge to be completed, the program should run in a debugger and be patched like there is no anti-patching techniques at all. 

If you managed to do that, Fantastic! Include that as a seperate writeup and upload both writeups as a bundle!


If any doubts, contact me at PranavAppu007 at discord server of crackmes.one.
