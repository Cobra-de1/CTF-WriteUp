## Goal
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

## Solution
We already have a shell of bandit26 in previous level, so check it.

We see the file `bandit27-do`, with is the same with `bandit20-do`, so just give the cat `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit27` to `bandit27-do` to excute it with bandit27 permission to cat the flag.
