## Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in `/etc/cron.d/` for the configuration and see what command is being executed.  
**NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!  
**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

## Solution
Let login to the server and check `/etc/cron.d/`.

The chall is same as 2 previous, we have `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh` run every minutes. But the command run in script is different.

We see that, all file in `/var/spool/bandit24` will be excute and delete. So we need to create a solve.sh file and copy it into `/var/spool/` to excute it, and cat the password to a file we can read.  

So first create a folder with all permission ( this is very important that the folder can write by any user).

Go to this folder and create a file `solve.sh` (we can create in this folder because we created it).

In the solve.sh, we write script to cat `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/Cobra-de1/password`, the password will cat to a file password in our folder.

Now copy to the `/var/spool/bandit24/` and wait 1 minutes before seeing `password`.
