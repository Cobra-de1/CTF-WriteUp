## Goal
After all this git stuff its time for another escape. Good luck!  

## Solution
Connect to the server, we have a shell with all upper case.

I donâ€™t know how to do next, so I read the command in challenge.

After googling, I find that the challenge use the Bourne shell, if you type the command `ls`, the shell excute is `sh LS`. After reading `man sh`, I find this.

The variable 0 is set to the name of the shell or shell script. In this case it's `$0 = sh`. So if I run `$0`, the shell being excuted is `sh` which is our normal shell.
