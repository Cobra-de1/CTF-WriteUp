## Goal
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not `/bin/bash`, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

## Solution
First login to the server.

We see a ssh key to login to bandit26, let try it.

But we fail,

Look back to the goal of this chall, the shell using by bandit26 is not `/bin/bash`, so we find what is it. Just go to `/etc/passwd` and find the default shell:

Look to `/usr/bin/showtext`.

We see the command more `~/text.txt`, search gg for more command, I know that the more command is use to display long (text) files on small screens or in a size limited terminal window. So we try to minimize the terminal to see what happen.  

So we reach the `more` command.

In the help menu of more command, we see a `v` option to startup `vi` at current line.

So just open the vim, in vim, we can start the shell with the command:
```
:set shell=/bin/bash and then type :shell
```

So we have the shell of bandit 26 to find password of bandit 27.
