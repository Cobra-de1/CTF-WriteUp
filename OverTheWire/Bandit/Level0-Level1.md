## Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `readme` located in the home directory. Use this password to log into `bandit1` using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Solution
```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme 
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
```
> Password: `boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1`
